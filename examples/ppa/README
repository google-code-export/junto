This example is current under construction. Documentation, etc., to
come (on no particular schedule). 

If all is compiled and setup, running "sh runppa.sh" in this directory
should create graph information in a ./data directory and then run
Junto on it and produce the output given in the file
"reference_output". Easily check it this way:

$ sh runppa.sh > my_output
$ diff my_output reference_output

Or, just do this if you don't need to look at the output:

$ ./runppa.sh | diff - reference_output

If all went as it should, you should see no differences.
